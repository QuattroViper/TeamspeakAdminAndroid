# Teamspeak Server Admin Android Application

I created this basic Android Application that can connect to a Teamspeak 3 server through the query port. 

The application is capable of 
- Connect to any Teamspeak 4 server with any port.
- Listing all clients connected to the server.
- Ban and kick clients.
- Poke clients with a message.
- View client information.
- Other small features.

The app is in alpha and is not being developed anymore due to the announcement of Teamspeak 5.
